	  NOTE: In order to authenticate connections you have to select
	  CRYPTO_HMAC and a hash function as well.

	  DRBD is a shared-nothing, synchronously replicated block device. It
	  is designed to serve as a building block for high availability
	  clusters and in this context, is a "drop-in" replacement for shared
	  storage. Simplistically, you could see it as a network RAID 1.

	  Each minor device has a role, which can be 'primary' or 'secondary'.
	  On the node with the primary device the application is supposed to
	  run and to access the device (/dev/drbdX). Every write is sent to
	  the local 'lower level block device' and, across the network, to the
	  node with the device in 'secondary' state.  The secondary device
	  simply writes the data to its lower level block device.

	  DRBD can also be used in dual-Primary mode (device writable on both
	  nodes), which means it can exhibit shared disk semantics in a
	  shared-nothing cluster.  Needless to say, on top of dual-Primary
	  DRBD utilizing a cluster file system is necessary to maintain for
	  cache coherency.

	  For automatic failover you need a cluster manager (e.g. heartbeat).
