# parameters you _need_ to change are the hostname, device, disk,
# meta-disk, address and port in the "on <hostname> {}" sections.
#
# you ought to know about the protocol, and the various timeouts.
#
# you probably want to set the rate in the syncer sections

#
# NOTE common pitfall:
# rate is given in units of _byte_ not bit
#

#
# increase timeout and maybe ping-int in net{}, if you see
# problems with "connection lost/connection established"
# (or change your setup to reduce network latency; make sure full
#  duplex behaves as such; check average roundtrip times while
#  network is saturated; and so on ...)

#
# Upgrading from DRBD-0.6.x
#
# Using the size parameter in the disk section (was disk-size) is
# no longer valid. The agreed disk size is now stored
# in DRBD's non volatile meta data files.
#
# NOTE that if you do not have some dedicated partition to use for
# the meta-data, you may use 'internal' meta-data.
#
#	THIS HOWEVER WILL DESTROY THE LAST 128M
#	OF THE LOWER LEVEL DEVICE.
#
# So you better make sure you shrink the filesystem by 128M FIRST!
# or by 132M just to be sure... :)

skip {
  As you can see, you can also comment chunks of text
  with a 'skip[optional nonsense]{ skipped text }' section.
  This comes in handy, if you just want to comment out
  some 'resource <some name> {...}' section:
  just precede it with 'skip'.

  The basic format of option assignment is
  <option name><linear whitespace><value>;
  
  It should be obvious from the examples below,
  but if you really care to know the details:
  
  <option name> :=
        valid options in the respective scope
  <value>  := <num>|<string>|<choice>|...
              depending on the set of allowed values
              for the respective option.
  <num>    := [0-9]+, sometimes with an optional suffix of K,M,G
  <string> := (<name>|\"([^\"\\\n]*|\\.)*\")+
  <name>   := [/_.A-Za-z0-9-]+
