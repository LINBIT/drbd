This module is the kernel-dependant driver for DRBD.  This is split out so
that multiple kernel driver versions can be installed, one for each
installed kernel.

%changelog
* Mon Apr 26 2006 14:10:07 +0200 Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.18-1)
 * Under high memory pressure it was possible to hit a deadlock 
   on a kmalloc(). Changed the GFP mask, it is no longer possible to
   deadlock it with memory pressure.
 * With very unlucky network timing during connect DRBD falls into 
   a connect / drop-connection loop, that as soon as DRBD is in this 
   loop is very stable. This is fixed now, DRBD detects this situation
   an breaks out of it.
 * Fix to the init-script. Now it waits until udev has created
   the device nodes of _all_ resources.
 * A small fix for the 32bit userland 64bit kernel people, running
   older kernels.
 * Improved handling of IO errors during initial read in of the
   activity log.

* Mon Mar  6 2006 14:43:41 +0200 Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.17-1)
 * There was a bug that could cause the activity log to be not applied 
   after a primary crash, when an other size than 127 elements was configured.
 * There was a bug in the activity log code, that could cause that the
   latest update to the AL is omitted at recovery time.
 * The "Marked additional XXKB as out-of-synced based on AL." message
   showed one one eighth of the real amount, fixed.

* Mon Feb 13 2006 15:52:00 +0200 Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.16-1)
 * DRBD no longer shrinks an consistent device if it gets connected to
   an smaller peer or attached to a smaller disk.
 * There was a bug related to the degr-wcf-timeout config option, it was
   never used in recent DRBD releases. Fixed.
 * Made DRBD work with Neil Brown's patch, that serializes recusive
   ralls to generic_make_request(). FC4 included that patch in its
   later kernels.
 * Minor fixes to drbdadm
 * Compiles now also with Linux-2.6.16-rc1
 * Updates to documentation and example config file to make it more
   clear that we talk about byte/second and not bit/second.

* Mon Dec 19 2005 14:44:00 +0200 Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.15-1)
 * Fixed a bug in the GC code that could cause a resync attempt
   in the wrong direction.
 * Made DRBD's compat_ioctls work with kernels higher than 2.6.14. This
   means DRBD builds on AMD64/x86_64 with 2.6.15 and higher again.
 * drbdadm no longer looks in the current directory for its 
   backend programs (=drbdsetup), but instead looks in the directory
   of the drbdadm executable and in $PATH.
 * Removed the examples from manpage, added a pointer to the HA-wiki.

* Mon Oct 17 2005 16:44:09 +0200 Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.14-1)
 * Fixed a SMP race condition introduced in 0.7.12, that could cause
   a lockup on a busy node in Primary/SyncSource state.
 * In case a disc failes during a read requests, the read requests
   is reissued to the peer. Now it also tells the peer that the disk
   broke. 
   Without that fix this bug could cause a resync in the wrong direction
   after a cluster restart.
 * Some improvements to the documentation.

* Thu Sep  1 2005 10:00:00 +0200 Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.13-1)
 * Fixed a SMP race condition that caused the resync process to stall
   after a few seconds to minutes.
 * The sync speed display is replaced by the word "stalled" in case the 
   syncer makes no progress within 20 seconds.
 * Some improvements to the documentation.

* Wed Aug 24 2005 15:01:10 +0200 Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.12-1)
 * The /proc/drbd code used a fixed single page buffer. This breaks 
   at about 30 configured devices. Changed that to use the seq_file
   interface.
 * Bind the source of TCP connections to the IP address that is
   mentioned in the configuration. 
 * Fixed a connection flip-flop bug when the two peers used different
   user provided sizes.
 * Various fixes in the online-resize code path, including online shrinking
   and handling the case that the memory allocation for the new bitmap
   failed.
 * Random improvements to drbdadm: 
   * The "size" option is now allowed in the disk section
   * A new "disable-ip-verification" option for the global section
   * The "disable-io-hints" option is not longer available.
   * Allow "drbdadm -- --size=XXX resize r0".
 * Fixed a potential very unlikely race condition that in the end would
   trigger an ERR in drbd_actlog.c:607. Actually I never saw this trigger.
 * Fixed a logic bug in _drbd_process_ee() that, paired with a race condition
   could trigger a "ASSERT(b->n_req == set_size)" upon disconnect.
 * Removed the "disable_io_hints" module parameter.
 * Added the "disable_bd_claim" module parameter, to allow users, WHO 
   KNOW WHAT THEY DO, to read-access the data on the secondary node.
 * Allow "drbdadm invalidate" only in StandAlone and Connected states. 
 * DRBD no longer goes into StandAlone mode, if there is an random network 
   error during the handshake phase, instead it retries the to connect.
   Only critical problems, e.g. incompatible protocols will cause it 
   to go into StandAlone mode.

* Tue Jun  7 2005 19:13:00 +0200 Lars Ellenberg <lars@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.11-1)
 * The upper limit of the runtime tuning parameter max_buffers 
   was ways too low for today's IBM storage controllers. 
   Was 32 - 10000 ; Now it is 32 - 131072 ( Now one could 
   allow DRBD to allocate up to half a gigabyte of memory as 
   receive buffers)
 * A fix to the Makefiles to make building of RPMs work on RAHS4.
 * A workaround to have DBRD running on PPC64 with Linux-2.4.x kernels,
   on Linux-2.6.x everything was fine already.
 * Removal of dead code (busy_blocks).
 * LINBIT drbd rpms now conflict with km_drbd
   (SuSE's kernel module source hook)
 * possibly existing /lib/modules/*/extra/drbd.ko are renamed to .orig in the
   post-install scripts to avoid conflicts with existing modules from
   distribution kernel packages
 * fixed flex input buffer overflow
   drbdadm_scanner.fl produced tokens of arbitrary length due to excessive use
   of "+" and "*" modifiers. Now these are replaced with "{x,y}" modifiers, so
   it should no longer segfault, which was actually observed e.g. with long
   continuous comment blocks (~5k). 

* Mon Jan 31 2005 10:17:00 +0200 Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.10-1)
 * 0.7.9 had a memory corruption bug and memory leakage (BIOs).
   This time I did the clone_bio() fix myself, and this release is
   supposed to work with SLES9 SP1, Linux-2.6.11 and Linux-2.6.12.

* Tue Jan 25 2005 11:31:00 +0200 Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.9-1)
 * A fix that makes DRBD work on SLES9 SP1 kernel, and 
   probabely will be also necessary for Linux-2.6.11

* Mon Jan 17 2005 12:55:01 +0200 Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.8-1)
  * Fixed a bug that caused the syncer to starve on devices 
    bigger than 2 TB on 32bit systems (=CONFIG_LBA).
  * Made online resizing actually work. Now it makes a lot
    more sense to put DRBD on top of LVM.
  * Made the user dialog to work on RedHat based distributions.
  * A small optimization that improves the performance of the 
    syncer when woking with IBM's ServRaid Controllers (ips).
    May have a positive effect with other Controllers as well.
  * Made epoch_size atomic. This removes a SMP race condition that
    could lead on some Xeon CPUs to an ASSERT printk, but did no other
    harm than printing messages to the syslog
  * Fixed write_gc.pl to work with the perl version delivered
    with RHAS3.
  * Made the initscript to abort if one of the setup commands fails.

* Tue Dec 15 2004 15:50:00 +0200 Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.7-1)
  * "drbdadm adjust [res...]" now does the calls to drbdsetup 
    in an improved order, first the disk config of all devices,
    then the syncer and net config last. With the old scheme
    drbdadm run in a timeout when setting up more than about 
    6 devices at once (startup script...).
  * New progress indication in the startup script.
  * Bugfix to a race that could cause a OOPS on a BUG() macro
    in mod_timer while starting resync. The more devices you have 
    the higher the probability to hit this race condition.
  * Fixed a bug in the sync-groups conde, that only showed up
    when you have more than 4 resources in your config. 
    The resync process was continued too early on the node in
    SyncTarget state.
  * Fixed a stupid typo in the range-check code, that was intoduced
    in 0.7.6. Drbdsetup allowed "max-buffers" to be in the range 
    from 32 to 32.
  * Makefiles are gcc-2.95 compatible again.

* Tue Nov 16 2004 14:59:00 +0200 Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.6-1)
  * Fixed bug that could cause a lockup of the receiver and
    asender threads, the visible outcome was that the syncer
    starves.
  * Fixed a bug that under specific circumstandes caused that the
    SyncSource node did not recognised that a resync process was
    finished.
  * "drbdadm invalidate [res]" was not working correct, while
    "drbdadm invalidate_remote [res]" works. Fixed the former.
  * Make DRBD work on Linux-2.6.10-rc2 and newer: Replaced
    sock_alloc() by sock_create(), replaced TASK_ZOMBIE by 
    EXIT_ZOMBIE.
  * Range checks in drbdadm for all numeric configure parameters.
  * A fix to make ioctl()s work on machines with 64bit kernel space 
    and 32bit user space. 
  * Ioctl()s are only allowed if the caller has CAP_SYS_ADMIN set.
  * Removal of warnings on 64bit architectures.
  * Backport of find_first_bit() for x86_64 aka AMD64 for use on 
    that architecture under Linux-2.4.x
  * Changed drbdadm to do the syncer config before the net config.
  * Changed the way drbdadm determines the minor_count parameter for
    module loading.
  * Improvements to the drbddisk script, to do the right thing
    in case Heartbeat is configured with a small timeout than DRBD.
  * On request of the debian package maintainers, the debian directory
    from SVN is not longer included in the tar.gz releases.

* Fri Oct 1 2004 11:33:00 +0200 Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.5-1)
  * Fix a bug that could case read requests to return wrong data
    on a node in Primary/SyncTaget state. (A very unlikely race,
    it is not known that this ever triggered; It was found by an 
    ASSERTION in the code)
  * Removed the 30MB/sec speeding limit for the syncer. (this was 
    intended as a debugging aid, but it was not removed in time)
  * A fix to drbdsetup, to make drbdadm adjust work if a resource
    is diskless.
  * Got rid of the compiler warning when build on a kernel with
    CONFIG_LBD not set.
  * Now the device nodes are created with sane permissions.
  * The debian package is now named "drbd0.7"
  * set_fs() is now also done for sendpage()
  * Better compatibility with early 2.4.x kernels (BH_Launder, min()/max())
  * Touch /var/lock/subsys/drbd, needed for RedHat based distros.
  * Improvements to the INSALL document
  * Removed HOWTO, ja, pt_BR ... all hopelessly outdated.
    disabled benchmark/run.sh

* Thu Sep 9 2004 19:50:00 +0200 Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.4-1)
  * Fixed a critical bug with Linux-2.4.x and HIGHMEM!
  * Fixed a bug that only showed up with the HIGHMEM problem on 
    Linux-2.4.x -> It caused the resync process to starve.
  * The drbd.spec file now creates /dev/drbd in the post-install stage.
  * Fixed support for more than 2TB storage. Now DRBD supports up to
    3.99TB storage. It will also tell you, that it is not supported if 
    you try to set up a bigger device.
  * Debian's build rules file now knows about the adjust_drbd_config_h.sh
    file.
  * DRBD_DISABLE_SENDPAGE available in drbd_config.h

* Fri Aug 27 2004 15:02:00 +0200 Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.3-1)
  * Fixed minor bugs in the handling of the generation counters.
  * prevent possible in-kernel buffer overflow in drbd_proc.c
  * Fixed debian's postinst script to create /dev/drbd? instead of /dev/nb?
  * drbd status:
    be nice to heartbeat, include "OK" in output.
  * added FullSync meta data flag to read/write gc.pl
  * make the RHEL3 happy (page_count no longer in mm.h, but in mm_inline.h)
  * [Patch by Pavel Semerad]. Also use the drbd_devfs_name on Linux-2.4.x
  * fix missing dependencies on drbd_config.h

* Fri Aug 06 2004 14:44:31 +0200 Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.2-1)
  * Proper handling of backing storage devices that occasionally fail 
    READA (=read ahead) requests. (E.g. LVM and MD)
  * DRBD now fails READA requests itself, if a resynchronisation is running
    and it would need to fetch the block from its peer.
  * "drbdadm adjust" had a race, which caused random errors. ( Missing
    waitpid() ). Fixed now.
  * Proper subtract SyncPause times from the syncer performance numbers.
  * Fix to the syncer progress bar in /proc/drbd.
  * Fix to debian build rules.

* Fri Jul 30 2004 13:50:38 +0200 Philipp Reisner <phil@linbit.com>
- drbd (0.7.1-1)
  * Upgrade instructions for 0.6.x -> 0.7.0 and 0.7.0 -> 0.7.1
  * Workaround for XFS' IO requests with page count of zero.
  * Handle the human and the timeout count correctly in the new init script.
  * The implementation of the incon-degr-cmd was missing, added.
  * Fix for integer overflow in /proc/drbd syncer progress display
  * Longer timeouts in drbdadm for drbdsetup commands witch operate on 
    meta data.
  * New major number 147 (officially registered at lanana.org).
  * Added a missing w_resume_next_wg() in case we stop syncing because
    of connection loss.
  * Fixed a Linux-2.2-ismus in recieve_data_tail(). Should considerably
    speed up protocols A and B.
  * Some work on vendor kernel compatibility

* Mon Jul 26 2004 18:39:38 +0200 Lars Ellenberg <l.g.e@web.de>
- update to SVN revision http://svn.drbd.org/drbd/trunk@1456
- drbd (0.7.0-1)
  Drbd-0.7 was actually forked off from drbd-0.6.1 (actually -pre18). 
  * Complete new way of doing resynchronisation. Does no longer need
    to do tricks with the nice value, and delivers very good performace.
  * Decoupling of role assignment (primary/secondary) from the direction
    of resynchronisation. (Necessary for primary/primary)
  * All "ack" and "ping" packets now go through the msock. 
    (Prerequisite for primary/primary)
  * Reworked a lot of internals to work with sector_t instead of
    blocknumbers. DRBD works now with XFS, and will be complete
    immune to changes in the block size.
  * Reworked the tl_ code, the user no longer has to specify the size
    for a preallocated transfer-log.
  * Improved metadata; Ao the device size is now stored in metadata,
    users no longer need to configure it.
  * Online resizing via "drbdsetup resize"
  * Resynchronisation groups "drbdsetup syncer -g"
  * New (very short!) sys-v init scripts, new userland tool "drbdadm"
  * Changes to the way we allocate memory. We want to survive hard OOM
    situations. (partially done, partially ongoing work) 
  * Implemented the Activity-Log and the persistent bitmap.
