9.3.0 (api:genl2/proto:86-101,118-123/transport:19)
--------
 * was forked off between 9.2.12 and 9.2.13
 * Implemented resync without replication and made it the default; the
   previous (drbd-9.2 and earlier) behavior is still available via a
   config option. With that, the resync operation begins with
   mirroring of application writes disabled, and it performs multiple
   resync passes, clearing bits in the bitmap. It enables application
   write mirroring when the resync is nearly complete. That reduces
   the I/O load during resync, and in most cases, it reduces resync
   time.
 * Implemented support for bitmap granularity between 4k and 1M,
   including exchanging bitmaps with peers with a different bitmap
   block size
 * Give filesystems mounted on DRBD a chance to bring their on-disk
   representations into a consistent state before suspending I/O.
 * Add support for omitting bitmap allocation for standalone devices
 * Explicit config option for drbd8-api-compatibility mode
 * Dropped support for RHEL7 and support for kernels older than 3.10.
 * All fixes from 9.2.13 to 9.2.16
 * Compatibility with Linux-6.18
