9.1.21-rc.1 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * fix a deadlock that can trigger when deleting a connection and
   another connection going down in parallel. This is a regression of
   9.1.20
 * Fix an out-of-bounds access when scanning the bitmap. It leads to a
   crash when the bitmap ends on a page boundary, and this is also a
   regression in 9.1.20.

9.1.20 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * Fix a kernel crash that is sometimes triggered when downing drbd
   resources in a specific, unusual order (was triggered by the
   Kubernetes CSI driver)
 * Fix a rarely triggering kernel crash upon adding paths to a
   connection by rehauling the path lists' locking
 * Fix the continuation of an interrupted initial resync
 * Fix the state engine so that an incapable primary does not outdate
   indirectly reachable secondary nodes
 * Fix a logic bug that caused drbd to pretend that a peer's disk is
   outdated when doing a manual disconnect on a down connection; with
   that cured impact on fencing and quorum.
 * Fix forceful demotion of suspended devices
 * Rehaul of the build system to apply compatibility patches out of
   place that allows one to build for different target kernels from a
   single drbd source tree
 * Updated compability code for Linux 6.8

9.1.19 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * Fix a resync decision case where drbd wrongly decided to do a full
   resync, where a partial resync was sufficient; that happened in a
   specific connect order when all nodes were on the same data
   generation (UUID)
 * Fix the online resize code to obey cached size information about
   temporal unreachable nodes
 * Fix a rare corner case in which DRBD on a diskless primary node
   failed to re-issue a read request to another node with a backing
   disk upon connection loss on the connection where it shipped the
   read request initially
 * Make timeout during promotion attempts interruptible
 * No longer write activity-log updates on the secondary node in a
   cluster with precisely two nodes with backing disk; this is a
   performance optimization
 * Reduce CPU usage of acknowledgment processing

9.1.18 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * Fixed connecting nodes with differently sized backing disks,
   specifically when the smaller node is primary, before establishing
   the connections
 * Fixed thawing a device that has I/O frozen after loss of quorum
   when a configuration change eases its quorum requirements
 * Properly fail TLS if requested (only available in drbd-9.2)
 * Fixed a race condition that can cause auto-demote to trigger right
   after an explicit promote
 * Fixed a rare race condition that could mess up the handshake result
   before it is committed to the replication state.
 * Preserve "tiebreaker quorum" over a reboot of the last node (3-node
   clusters only)
 * Update compatibility code for Linux 6.6

9.1.17 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * fix a potential crash when configuring drbd to bind to a
   non-existent local IP address (this is a regression of drbd-9.1.8)
 * Cure a very seldom triggering race condition bug during
   establishing connections; when you triggered it, you got an OOPS
   hinting to list corruption
 * fix a race condition regarding operations on the bitmap while
   forgetting a bitmap slot and a pointless warning
 * Fix handling of unexpected (on a resource in secondary role) write
   requests
 * Fix a corner case that can cause a process to hang when closing the
   DRBD device, while a connection gets re-established
 * Correctly block signal delivery during auto-demote
 * Improve the reliability of establishing connections
 * Do not clear the transport with `net-options --set-defaults`. This
   fix avoids unexpected disconnect/connect cycles upon an `adjust`
   when using the 'lb-tcp' or 'rdma' transports in drbd-9.2.
 * New netlink packet to report path status to drbdsetup
 * Improvements to the content and rate-limiting of many log messages
 * Update compatibility code and follow Linux upstream development
   until Linux 6.5

9.1.16 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * shorten times DRBD keeps IRQs on one CPU disabled. Could lead
   to connection interruption under specific conditions
 * fix a corner case where resync did not start after resync-pause
   state flapped
 * fix online adding of volumes/minors to an already connected resource
 * fix a possible split-brain situation with quorum enabled with
   ping-timeout set to (unusual) high value
 * fix a locking problem that could lead to kernel OOPS
 * ensure resync can continue (bitmap-based) after interruption
   also when it started as a full-resync first
 * correctly handle meta-data when forgetting diskless peers
 * fix a possibility of getting a split-brain although quorum enabled
 * correctly propagate UUIDs after resync following a resize operation.
   Consequence could be a full resync instead of a bitmap-based one
 * fix a rare race condition that can cause a drbd device to end up
   with WFBitMapS/Established replication states

9.1.15 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * fix how flush requests are marked when submitted to the Linux IO
   stack on the secondary node
 * when establishing a connection failed with a two-pc timeout, a
   receiver thread deadlocked, causing drbdsetup calls to block on
   that resource (difficult to trigger)
 * fixed a NULL-ptr deref (a OOPS) caused by a rare race condition
   while taking a resource down
 * fix a possible hard kernel-lockup, can only be triggerd when a
   CPU-mask is configured
 * updated kernel compatibility to at least Linux head and also fixed
   a bug in the compat checks/rules that caused OOPSes of the previous
   drbd releases when compiled with Linux-6.2 (or on RHEL 9.2 kernel).
 * fix an aspect of the data-generation (UUID) handling where DRBD
   failed to do a resync when a diskless node in the remaining
   partition promotes and demotes while a diskful node is isolated
 * fix an aspect of the data-generation (UUID) handling where DRBD
   considered a node to have unrelated data; this bug was triggered by
   a sequence involving removing two nodes from a cluster and readding
   one with the "day-0" UUIDs.
 * do not block specific state changes (promote, demote, attach, and
   detach) when only some nodes add a new minor

9.1.14 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * fix a race with concurrent promotion and demotion, which can
   lead to an unexpected "split-brain" later on
 * fix a specific case where promotion was allowed where it should not
 * fix a race condition between auto-promote and a second two-phase
   commit that can lead to a DRBD thread locking up in an endless loop
 * fix several bugs with "resync-after":
  - missing resync-resume when minor numbers run in opposite
    direction as the resync-after dependencies
  - a race that might lead to an OOPS in add_timer()
 * fix an OOPS when reading from in_flight_summary in debugfs
 * fix a race that might lead to an endless loop of printing
   "postponing start_resync" while starting a resync
 * fix diskless node with a diskfull with a 4KiB backend
 * simplify remembering two-pc parents, maybe fixing a one-time-seen bug
 * derive abort_local_transaction timeout from ping-timeout

9.1.13 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * when calculating if a partition has quorum, take into account if
   the missing nodes might have quorum
 * fix forget-peer for diskless peers
 * clear the resync_again counter upon disconnect
 * also call the unfence handler when no resync happens
 * do not set bitmap bits when attaching to an up-to-date disk (late)
 * work on bringing the out-of-tree DRBD9 closer to DRBD in the upstream
   kernel; Use lru_cahche.ko from the installed kernel whenever possible

9.1.12 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * fix a race that could result in connection attempts getting aborted
   with the message "sock_recvmsg returned -11"
 * rate limit messages in case the peer can not write the backing storage
   and it does not finish the necessary state transitions
 * reduced the receive timeout during connecting to the intended 5 seconds
   (ten times ping-ack timeout)
 * losing the connection at a specific point in time during establishing
   a connection could cause a transition to StandAlone; fixed that, so
   that it keeps trying to connect
 * fix a race that could lead to a fence-peer handler being called
   unexpectedly when the fencing policy is changed at the moment before
   promoting

9.1.11 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * The change introduced with 9.1.10 created another problem that might
   lead to premature request completion (kernel crash); reverted that
   change and fix it in another way

9.1.10 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * fix a regression introduced with 9.1.9; using protocol A on SMP
   with heavy IO can might cause kernel crash

9.1.9 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * fix a mistake in the compat generation code; it broke DRBD on
   partitions on kernel older than linux 5.10 (this was introduced
   with drbd-9.1.8; not affected: logical volumes)
 * fix for a bug (introduced with drbd-9.0.0), that caused possible
   inconsistencies in the mirror when using the 'resync-after' option
 * fix a bug that could cause a request to get stuck after an unlucky
   timing with a loss of connection
 * close a very small timing window between connect and promote that
   could lead to the new-current-uuid not being transmitted to the
   concurrently connecting peer, which might lead to denied connections
   later on
 * fix a recently introduced OOPS when adding new volumes to a
   connected resource
 * fix online attach when the connection to a 3rd node is down

9.1.8 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * restore protocol compatibility with drbd-8.4
 * detect peers that died silently when starting a two-phase-commit
 * correctly abort two-phase-commits when a connection breaks between
   phases 1 and 2
 * allow re-connect to a node that was forced into secondary role and
   where an opener is still present from the last time it was primary
 * fix a race condition that allowed to configure two peers with the
   same node id
 * ensure that an open() call fails within the auto-promote timeout
   if it can not succeed
 * build fixes for RHEL9
 * following upstream changes to DRBD up to Linux 5.17 and updated compat

9.1.7 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:18)
--------
 * avoid deadlock upon trying to down an io-frozen DRBD device that
   has a file system mounted
 * fix DRBD to not send too large resync requests at multiples of 8TiB
 * fix for a "forgotten" resync after IO was suspended due to lack of quorum
 * refactored IO suspend/resume fixing several bugs; the worst one could
   lead to premature request completion
 * disable discards on diskless if diskful peers do not support it
 * make demote to secondary a two-phase state transition; that guarantees that
   after demotion, DRBD will not write to any meta-data in the cluster
 * enable "--force primary" in for no-quorum situations
 * allow graceful recovery of primary lacking quorum and therefore
   have forzen IO requests; that includes "--force secondary"
 * following upstream changes to DRBD up to Linux 5.15 and updated compat

9.1.6 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:17)
--------
 * fix IO to internal meta-data for backing device larger than 128TB
 * fix resending requests towards diskless peers, this is relevant when
   fencing is enabled, but the connection is re-established before fencing
   succeeds; when the bug triggered it lead to "stuck" requests
 * remove lockless buffer pages handling; it still contained very hard to
   trigger bugs
 * make sure DRBD's resync does not cause unnecessary allocation in
   a thinly provisioned backing device on a resync target node
 * avoid unnecessary resync (or split-brain) due to a wrongly generated
   new current UUID when an already IO frozen DBRD gets new writes
 * small fix to autopromote, when an application tries a read-only open
   before it does a read-write open immediately after the peer primary
   vanished ungracefully
 * split out the secure boot key into a package on its own, that is
   necessary to allow installation of multiple drbd kernel module packages
 * Support for building containers for flacar linux

9.1.5 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:17)
--------
 * merged all changes from drbd-9.0.32
  - fix a read-access-after-free, that could cause an OOPs; triggers with
    an unusual configuration with a secondary having a smaller AL than
    the primary or a diskless primary and heavy IO
  - avoid a livelock that can cause long IO delays during resync on a
    primary resync-target node
  - following upstream changes to DRBD up to Linux 5.14 and updated compat
    (including RHEL9-beta)
  - fix module override for Oracle-Linux
 * fixed a locking regression of the 9.1 branch, only relevant in
   the moment a local backing device delivers an IO error to drbd
 * removed compat support for kernel older than Linux-3.10 (RHEL7)
 * code cleanups and refactoring

9.1.4 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:17)
--------
 * merged all changes from drbd-9.0.31
 * enabled dynamic debug on some additional log messages
 * remove (broken) write conflict resolution, replace it with warning
   about the fact
 * debugfs entry for the interval tree

9.1.3 (api:genl2/proto:110-120/transport:17)
--------
 * merged all fixes from drbd-9.0.30-0rc1
 * fix a corner-case NULL deref in the lockless buffer pages handling; the
   regression was introduced with 9.1.0 (released Feb 2021); To my knowledge
   it took 6 months until someone triggered it for the first time
 * fix sending a P_PEERS_IN_SYNC packet into a fresh connection (before
   handshake packets); this problem was introduced when the drbd-8.x
   compatibility code was removed
 * remove sending a DRBD-barrier packet when processing a REQ_PREFLUSH
   request, that improves IO-depth and improves performance with that

9.1.2 (api:genl2/proto:110-120/transport:17)
--------
 * merged all fixes from drbd-9.0.29; other than that no changes in this branch

9.1.1 (api:genl2/proto:110-119/transport:17)
--------
 * fix a temporal deadlock you could trigger when you exercise promotion races
   and mix some read-only openers into the test case
 * fix for bitmap-copy operation in a very specific and unlikely case where
   two nodes do a bitmap-based resync due to disk-states
 * fix size negotiation when combining nodes of different CPU architectures
   that have different page sizes
 * fix a very rare race where DRBD reported wrong magic in a header
   packet right after reconnecting
 * fix a case where DRBD ends up reporting unrelated data; it affected
   thinly allocated resources with a diskless node in a recreate from day0
   event
 * changes to socket buffer sizes get applied to established connections immediately;
   before it was applied after a re-connect
 * add exists events for path objects
 * fix a merge-mistake that broke compatibility with 5.10 kernels

9.1.0 (api:genl2/proto:110-119/transport:16)
--------
 * was forked off from drbd 9.0.19
 * has all changes up to 9.0.28-1
 * locking in the IO-submit code path was considerably improved,
   allowing multiple CPU to submit in parallel
