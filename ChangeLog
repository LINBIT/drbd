9.2.14-rc.1 (api:genl2/proto:86-101,118-122/transport:19)
--------
 * Fix a race condition between write requests and very short resyncs
   that might cause DRBD to fail to resync that racing write.
 * Fix the suspend-IO command so that it waits until all pending
   writes are completed before it returns. From now on, it can be used
   to create consistent snapshots of the primary and the secondary.
 * Improve DRBD's pooling of buffer pages. The old implementation
   stopped freeing any of those buffer pages if the kernel would leak
   a single page reference.
 * Fix corner case CM leaks in the RDMA transport.
 * Fix a warning on recent kernels (RHEL10) regarding DRBD failing to
   set queue parameters for zoned block devices.
 * Dockerfile for RHEL10
 * Compatibility with Linux 6.14 and 6.15

9.2.13 (api:genl2/proto:86-101,118-122/transport:19)
--------
 * Fix a bug in the rs-discard-granularity feature; when having three
   or more replicas and after a particular resync scenario in the
   final consequence, it led to inconsistencies in the mirroring aka
   data corruption
 * Fix a bug that causes drbd not to finish a write request; DRBD
   noticed that the request did not finish and abandoned the
   connection; it happened only on resync-target primaries
 * Fix a bug that causes machine freeze (without OOPS message) under
   particular heavy network load conditions (a missing call to
   skb_abort_seq_read())
 * An up-to-date node no longer gets outdated by a far (not a
   neighbor) primary that is incapable (I.e. has an inconsistent disk
   and no access to up-to-date data)
 * Fix for a race condition between new writes getting submitted and a
   connection getting abandoned due to a send error; when it triggered,
   DRBD failed to complete a (or multiple) write request(s)
 * Fix a (never observed) race condition that causes false ping timeouts
 * Fix a minor memory leak; it failed to free the memory allocated for
   a specific class of state change log messages
 * Fix a reference counting bug in the RDMA transport upon address or
   route resolution errors
 * Fix detecting dead peers on idle connections in the RDMA transport
 * Enable TCP keepalive packets by default in the TCP transports
 * Add a DKMS package for RPM-based Linux distributions
 * Add a docker recipe for sles15
 * Compatibility with coccinelle 1.2
 * Compatibility with Linux 6.13

9.2.12 (api:genl2/proto:86-101,118-122/transport:19)
--------
 * Fix a complicated distributed deadlock corner case that caused
   DRBD to being unable to reconnect after losing connection during
   a resync
 * Fix the RDMA transport for use with an intel card; fixed various
   aspects where we depended on Mellanox cards' behavior
 * Changes merged from 9.1.22
  - Fix a corner case that can happen when DRBD establishes multiple
    connections in parallel, which could lead one connection to end up in
    an inconsistent replication state of WFBitMapT/Established
  - Fix a corner case in which a reconciliation resync ends up in
    WFBitMapT/Established
  - Restrict protocol compatibility to the most recent 8.4 and 9.0 releases
  - Fix a corner case causing a module ref leak on drbd_transport_tcp;
    if it hits, you can not rmmod it
  - rate-limit resync progress while resync is paused
  - resync-target inherits history UUIDs when resync finishes,
    this can prevent unexpected "unrelared data" events later
  - Updated compatibility code for Linux 6.11 and 6.12

9.2.11 (api:genl2/proto:86-122/transport:19)
--------
 * Do not block del-minor or down operations if the RDMA/Infiniband
   stack cleans up slowly.
 * Changes merged from 9.1.22
  - Upgrade from partial resync to a full resync if necessary when the
    user manually resolves a split-brain situation
  - Fix a potential NULL deref when a disk fails while doing a
    forget-peer operation.
  - Fix a rcu_read_lock()/rcu_read_unlock() imbalance
  - Restart the open() syscall when a process auto promoting a drbd device gets
    interrupted by a signal
  - Remove a deadlock that caused DRBD to connect sometimes
    exceptionally slow
  - Make detach operations interruptible
  - Added dev_is_open to events2 status information
  - Improve log readability for 2PC state changes and drbd-threads
  - Updated compability code for Linux 6.9

9.2.10 (api:genl2/proto:86-122/transport:19)
--------
 * Changes merged from 9.1.21
  - fix a deadlock that can trigger when deleting a connection and
    another connection going down in parallel. This is a regression of
    9.1.20
  - Fix an out-of-bounds access when scanning the bitmap. It leads to a
    crash when the bitmap ends on a page boundary, and this is also a
    regression in 9.1.20.

9.2.9 (api:genl2/proto:86-122/transport:19)
--------
 * Allow resync operations between secondaries if the sync source is
   not connected with the primary node
 * Changes merged from 9.1.20
  - Fix a kernel crash that is sometimes triggered when downing drbd
    resources in a specific, unusual order (was triggered by the
    Kubernetes CSI driver)
  - Fix a rarely triggering kernel crash upon adding paths to a
    connection by rehauling the path lists' locking
  - Fix the continuation of an interrupted initial resync
  - Fix the state engine so that an incapable primary does not outdate
    indirectly reachable secondary nodes
  - Fix a logic bug that caused drbd to pretend that a peer's disk is
    outdated when doing a manual disconnect on a down connection; with
    that cured impact on fencing and quorum.
  - Fix forceful demotion of suspended devices
  - Rehaul of the build system to apply compatibility patches out of
    place that allows one to build for different target kernels from a
    single drbd source tree
  - Updated compability code for Linux 6.8

9.2.8 (api:genl2/proto:86-122/transport:19)
--------
 * Fix the not-terminating-resync phenomenon between two nodes with
   backing disk in the presence of a diskless primary node under
   heavy I/O
 * Fix a rare race condition aborting connections claiming wrong
   protocol magic
 * Fix various problems of the checksum-based resync, including kernel
   crashes
 * Fix soft lockup messages in the RDMA transport under heavy I/O
 * changes merged from drbd-9.1.19
  - Fix a resync decision case where drbd wrongly decided to do a full
    resync, where a partial resync was sufficient; that happened in a
    specific connect order when all nodes were on the same data
    generation (UUID)
  - Fix the online resize code to obey cached size information about
    temporal unreachable nodes
  - Fix a rare corner case in which DRBD on a diskless primary node
    failed to re-issue a read request to another node with a backing
    disk upon connection loss on the connection where it shipped the
    read request initially
  - Make timeout during promotion attempts interruptible
  - No longer write activity-log updates on the secondary node in a
    cluster with precisely two nodes with backing disk; this is a
    performance optimization
  - Reduce CPU usage of acknowledgment processing

9.2.7 (api:genl2/proto:86-122/transport:19)
--------
 * Fixed wrong tx-timeouts in the RDMA transport
 * Recreate buffers promptly for the RDMA transport, improving
   performance a lot
 * changes merged from drbd-9.1.18
  - Fixed connecting nodes with differently sized backing disks,
    specifically when the smaller node is primary, before establishing
    the connections
  - Fixed thawing a device that has I/O frozen after loss of quorum
    when a configuration change eases its quorum requirements
  - Properly fail TLS if requested (only available in drbd-9.2)
  - Fixed a race condition that can cause auto-demote to trigger right
    after an explicit promote
  - Fixed a rare race condition that could mess up the handshake result
    before it is committed to the replication state.
  - Preserve "tiebreaker quorum" over a reboot of the last node (3-node
    clusters only)
  - Update compatibility code for Linux 6.6

9.2.6 (api:genl2/proto:86-122/transport:19)
--------
 * a series of fixes to the RDMA transport, making it compatible with
   more recent Mellanox cards and fixes in general to the RDMA code
 * Tuning parameter rdma-ctrl-(snd|rcv)buf-size for fine tuning
 * Makefile updates for compiling with OFED
 * optional TLS encryption for the TCP transport, based on kTLS with
   TLS handshakes in userspace
 * a new load-balancing TCP transport "lb-tcp" that establises all
   configured paths in paralle and distributes the packet load
   over them
 * a new config net option 'load-balance-paths' that easens
   the steps of renaming the transports tcp to tcp-legacy and
   lb-tcp to tcp and the final removal of the older tcp
   implementation
 * changes merged from drbd-9.1.17
  - fix a potential crash when configuring drbd to bind to a
    non-existent local IP address (this is a regression of drbd-9.1.8)
  - Cure a very seldom triggering race condition bug during
    establishing connections; when you triggered it, you got an OOPS
    hinting to list corruption
  - fix a race condition regarding operations on the bitmap while
    forgetting a bitmap slot and a pointless warning
  - Fix handling of unexpected (on a resource in secondary role) write
    requests
  - Fix a corner case that can cause a process to hang when closing the
    DRBD device, while a connection gets re-established
  - Correctly block signal delivery during auto-demote
  - Improve the reliability of establishing connections
  - Do not clear the transport with `net-options --set-defaults`. This
    fix avoids unexpected disconnect/connect cycles upon an `adjust`
    when using the 'lb-tcp' or 'rdma' transports in drbd-9.2.
  - New netlink packet to report path status to drbdsetup
  - Improvements to the content and rate-limiting of many log messages
  - Update compatibility code and follow Linux upstream development
    until Linux 6.5

9.2.5 (api:genl2/proto:86-122/transport:18)
--------
 * changes merged from drbd-9.1.16
  - shorten times DRBD keeps IRQs on one CPU disabled. Could lead
    to connection interruption under specific conditions
  - fix a corner case where resync did not start after resync-pause
    state flapped
  - fix online adding of volumes/minors to an already connected resource
  - fix a possible split-brain situation with quorum enabled with
    ping-timeout set to (unusual) high value
  - fix a locking problem that could lead to kernel OOPS
  - ensure resync can continue (bitmap-based) after interruption
    also when it started as a full-resync first
  - correctly handle meta-data when forgetting diskless peers
  - fix a possibility of getting a split-brain although quorum enabled
  - correctly propagate UUIDs after resync following a resize operation.
    Consequence could be a full resync instead of a bitmap-based one
  - fix a rare race condition that can cause a drbd device to end up
    with WFBitMapS/Established replication states

9.2.4 (api:genl2/proto:86-122/transport:18)
--------
 * fix a possible deadlock when disconnecting during a resync
 * fix a possible hard kernel-lockup
 * changes merged from drbd-9.1.15
  - fix how flush requests are marked when submitted to the Linux IO
    stack on the secondary node
  - when establishing a connection failed with a two-pc timeout, a
    receiver thread deadlocked, causing drbdsetup calls to block on
    that resource (difficult to trigger)
  - fixed a NULL-ptr deref (a OOPS) caused by a rare race condition
    while taking a resource down
  - updated kernel compatibility to at least Linux head and also fixed
    a bug in the compat checks/rules that caused OOPSes of the previous
    drbd releases when compiled with Linux-6.2 (or on RHEL 9.2 kernel).
  - fix an aspect of the data-generation (UUID) handling where DRBD
    failed to do a resync when a diskless node in the remaining
    partition promotes and demotes while a diskful node is isolated
  - fix an aspect of the data-generation (UUID) handling where DRBD
    considered a node to have unrelated data; this bug was triggered by
    a sequence involving removing two nodes from a cluster and readding
    one with the "day-0" UUIDs.
  - do not block specific state changes (promote, demote, attach, and
    detach) when only some nodes add a new minor

9.2.3 (api:genl2/proto:86-122/transport:18)
--------
 * improve matching ACKs to in-memory request objects;
   inexact matches were a source of unexpected connection losses
 * merge changes from drbd-9.1.14
  - fix a race with concurrent promotion and demotion, which can
    lead to an unexpected "split-brain" later on
  - fix a specific case where promotion was allowed where it should not
  - fix a race condition between auto-promote and a second two-phase
    commit that can lead to a DRBD thread locking up in an endless loop
  - fix several bugs with "resync-after":
   - missing resync-resume when minor numbers run in opposite
     direction as the resync-after dependencies
   - a race that might lead to an OOPS in add_timer()
  - fix an OOPS when reading from in_flight_summary in debugfs
  - fix a race that might lead to an endless loop of printing
    "postponing start_resync" while starting a resync
  - fix diskless node with a diskfull with a 4KiB backend
  - simplify remembering two-pc parents, maybe fixing a one-time-seen bug
  - derive abort_local_transaction timeout from ping-timeout

9.2.2 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * fix spurious PingAck timeout a second time; we need to use a drbd
   owned workqueue to guarantee the required low-latency replies
 * Fix connection abort during resync with log message
   "Unexpected resync write ack at ..." a regression of drbd-9.2
 * fix a race condition that can lead to NULL-ptr deref during resync
 * merged changes from drbd-9.1.13
  - when calculating if a partition has quorum, take into account if
    the missing nodes might have quorum
  - fix forget-peer for diskless peers
  - clear the resync_again counter upon disconnect
  - also call the unfence handler when no resync happens
  - do not set bitmap bits when attaching to an up-to-date disk (late)
  - work on bringing the out-of-tree DRBD9 closer to DRBD in the upstream
    kernel; Use lru_cahche.ko from the installed kernel whenever possible

9.2.1 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * fix spurious PingAck timeout, a regression of ack-processing in bottom half
   (introduced with 9.2.0)
 * support merging of discards during resync even if the discard granularity
   of the backing device is larger than 128MiB
 * merged changes from the drbd-9.1 branch, including
  - fix a race that could result in connection attempts getting aborted
    with the message "sock_recvmsg returned -11"
  - rate limit messages in case the peer can not write the backing storage
    and it does not finish the necessary state transitions
  - reduced the receive timeout during connecting to the intended 5 seconds
    (ten times ping-ack timeout)
  - losing the connection at a specific point in time during establishing
    a connection could cause a transition to StandAlone; fixed that, so
    that it keeps trying to connect
  - fix a race that could lead to a fence-peer handler being called
    unexpectedly when the fencing policy is changed at the moment before
    promoting

9.2.0 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * merged changes from the drbd-9.1 branch, including
  - fix a race that could lead to an unexpected loss of connection
    related to internal concurrency; it manifested itself as
    "BAD! BarrierAck #X received with n_writes=..." in the logs
  - fix a race that could lead to an unexpected loss of connection
    if a node in the quorate partition promotes (too) quickly
  - follow upstream and compat code for up to Linux 5.19

9.2.0-rc.8 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * fix the RDMA transport to work on more recent kernels (like RHEL9)
 * improve transmit timeout handling of the RDMA transport
 * register DRBD has pernet device for namespace management
 * merged fixes from the drbd-9.1 branch, including
  - request handling (9.1.11)

--------
 * support for network namespaces
 * multiple fixes to the merge-discards-during-resync functionality
 * fix reference counting in AL with drbd-8.4 peers
 * stricter limit for the set of characters allowed in resource names
 * merge changes from the drbd 9.1.9 release

9.2.0-rc.6 (api:genl2/proto:86-121/transport:18)
--------
 * fixes to the new way of coordinating resync and application IO
 * merge discard requests during resync on a resync target node;
   This can speed up the resync progress by multiple orders of magnitude
 * Merged changes from the 9.1.8 release
  - restore protocol compatibility with drbd-8.4
  - detect peers that died silently when starting a two-phase-commit
  - correctly abort two-phase-commits when a connection breaks between
    phases 1 and 2
  - allow re-connect to a node that was forced into secondary role and
    where an opener is still present from the last time it was primary
  - fix a race condition that allowed to configure two peers with the
    same node id
  - ensure that an open() call fails within the auto-promote timeout
    if it can not succeed
  - build fixes for RHEL9
  - following upstream changes to DRBD up to Linux 5.17 and updated compat

9.2.0-rc.4 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:18)
--------
 * Merged fixes from the 9.1.6 release
  - fix IO to internal meta-data for backing device larger than 128TB
  - fix resending requests towards diskless peers, this is relevant when
    fencing is enabled, but the connection is re-established before fencing
    succeeds; when the bug triggered it lead to "stuck" requests
  - remove lockless buffer pages handling; it still contained very hard to
    trigger bugs
  - make sure DRBD's resync does not cause unnecessary allocation in
    a thinly provisioned backing device on a resync target node
  - avoid unnecessary resync (or split-brain) due to a wrongly generated
    new current UUID when an already IO frozen DBRD gets new writes
  - small fix to autopromote, when an application tries a read-only open
    before it does a read-write open immediately after the peer primary
    vanished ungracefully
  - split out the secure boot key into a package on its own, that is
    necessary to allow installation of multiple drbd kernel module packages
  - Support for building containers for flacar linux

9.2.0-rc.3 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:18)
--------
 * fix a corner case that might cause conflicting requests (touching
   a storage area that is under resync) to not terminate
 * merge from drbd-9.0: fix failing read-only open immediately after
   a primary peer left the cluster ungracefully

9.2.0-rc.2 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:18)
--------
 * Fix broken wire compatibility with drbd-9.x
 * Fix DKMS builds when the kernel config has CONFIG_INFINIBAND=n

9.2.0-rc.1 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:18)
--------
 * was forked off between 9.1.4 and 9.1.5
 * implemented a geniue way of coordinating resync and application IO;
   removed the internal resync_lru
 * receive and process ack-packets in TCP/RDMA SOFTIRQ context, that
   improves latency on all write operations; removed ack_receiver thread
 * add RDMA transport for IB, RoCE networking
